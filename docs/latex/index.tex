Design Description\+: The purpose of this program is to process WAV files and give the user the choice to export them as CSV files. The program reads in a file and then gives the user a menu with choices. They can choose to manipulate the WAV file\textquotesingle{}s metadata before the audio is manipulated. After choosing whether or not to change the metadata, another menu is given and the user can choose to maipulate the actual audio with normalization, echo, or noisegating. After that, the user saves the modified WAV file to a new file name. The program prevents them from naming the WAV file as something that exists. The user then can choose if they want the metadata exported to a CSV file and then the program ends.

Challenges\+: During this programming assignment, we struggled with writing things to a new file. The audio processing portion was also pretty difficult for us. We had to do a lot of research but in the end, we put things together. It was a difficult assignment, but we struggled as a team and we did our best. Thank you for a great semester!
