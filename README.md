# CS 202 Semester Project
## WAV File Processing Application
### Group PT13


Members: Kaeden Carver, Justin Kelly, Vanessa Quijano Delgado

Responsibilities:
Kaeden - File I/O, Metadata, WavHeader
Justin - Normalization, Doxygen, comments
Vanessa - Template, Interface, Echo and Noisegate, Shared Library

Design Description:
The purpose of this program is to process WAV files and give the user the choice to export them
as CSV files. The program reads in a file and then gives the user a menu with choices. They can 
choose to manipulate the WAV file's metadata before the audio is manipulated. After choosing 
whether or not to change the metadata, another menu is given and the user can choose to 
maipulate the actual audio with normalization, echo, or noisegating. After that, the user saves
the modified WAV file to a new file name. The program prevents them from naming the WAV file as 
something that exists. The user then can choose if they want the metadata exported to a CSV file
and then the program ends.

Challenges:
During this programming assignment, we struggled with writing things to a new file. The audio processing
portion was also pretty difficult for us. We had to do a lot of research but in the end, we put things 
together. It was a difficult assignment, but we struggled as a team and we tried our best ok. Thank you
for a great semester!
